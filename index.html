ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free.
They surround us in the same way as a language surrounds us.
They have entered the mainstream of life over which they no
longer, in themselves, have power. - John Berger, Ways of Seeing</i></p>

Images representing unrelated aspects of culture, memes, thrown together without context or relation. It is <b>people</b> who have the power, not the images. The images are to be used.</p>
